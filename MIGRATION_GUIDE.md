The DSL of `oj_serializers` is meant to be similar to the one provided by `active_model_serializers` to make the migration process simple,
though the goal is not to be a drop-in replacement. 

## Rendering 🛠

To use the same format in controllers, using the `root`, `serializer`, `each_serializer` options, you should require the compatibility layer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/json.rb
require 'oj_serializers/compat'
```

Otherwise, use `one` and `many` to serialize objects or enumerables:

```ruby
render json: {
  favorite: LegacyAlbumSerializer.new(album),
  purchases: albums.map { |album| LegacyAlbumSerializer.new(album) },
}

# becomes

render json: {
  favorite: AlbumSerializer.one(album),
  purchases: AlbumSerializer.many(albums),
}
```

### Attributes

Specially in the beginning, you can replace `attributes` with `ams_attributes` to preserve the same behavior.

```ruby
class AlbumSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :name, :release

  has_many :songs

  def release
    album.release_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')
  end

  def include_release?
    album.released?
  end
end

# becomes

class AlbumSerializer < Oj::Serializer
  ams_attributes :name, :release

  has_many :songs, serializer: SongSerializer

  def release
    album.release_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')
  end

  def include_release?
    album.released?
  end
end
```

Notice that the library honors any `include` methods you have defined, and that it requires a serializer to be specified for associations.

Have in mind that this library provides [faster serialization methods][readme] such as `record_attributes`.

## Migrate gradually, one at a time

You can use these serializers inside arrays, hashes, or even inside `ActiveModel::Serializer`.

```ruby
class LegacyAlbumSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :songs

  def songs
    SongSerializer.many(object.songs)
  end
end
```

As a result, you can gradually replace the serializers one by one as needed.

## Path Helpers 🛣

In case you need to access path helpers in your serializers, you can use the
following:

```ruby
class BaseJsonSerializer < Oj::Serializer
  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers

  def default_url_options
    Rails.application.routes.default_url_options
  end
end
```

One slight variation that might make it easier to maintain in the long term is
to use a separate singleton service to provide the url helpers and options, and
make it available as `urls`.

## Controller & Params 🚧

This pattern is usually a bad practice, because it couples the serializer to the
controller, making it harder to reuse or test independently.

However, it can be handy if you were already relying on this with `ActiveModel::Serializer`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action { Thread.current[:current_controller] = self }
end

class BaseJsonSerializer < Oj::Serializer
  def scope
    @scope ||= Thread.current[:current_controller]
  end

  def params
    @params ||= scope&.params || {}
  end
end
```

Using [`request_store`][request_store] or [`request_store_rails`][request_store_rails] is advisable instead of using
`Thread.current`, since keeping a reference to a controller after the request is
done could cause memory bloat and additional problems.
