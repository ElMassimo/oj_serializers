## [Oj Serializers 2.0.0 (2023-03-27)](https://github.com/ElMassimo/oj_serializers/pull/9)

### Features âœ¨

- Improved performance (20% to 40% faster than v1)
- Added `render_as_hash` to efficiently build a Hash from the serializer
- `transform_keys :camelize`: a built-in setting to convert keys, in a way that does not affect runtime performance
- `sort_keys_by :name`: allows to sort the response alphabetically, without affecting runtime performance
- `render` shortcut, unifying `one` and `many`
- `attribute` as an easier approach to define serializer attributes

### Breaking Changes

Since returning a `Hash` is more convenient than returning a `Oj::StringWriter`, and performance is comparable, `default_format :hash` is now the default.

The previous APIs will still be available as `one_as_json` and `many_as_json`, as well as `default_format :json` to make the library work like in version 1.
